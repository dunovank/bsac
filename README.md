## BSAC - Believer-Skeptic/Actor-Critic Attractor Model


Currently includes Believer-Skeptic Attractor Network http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/01/18/037085, representing
direct-indirect competition within single action channel of BG. Goal is
to implement a full rate-based neural network including the following nodes

#### CTX
 * Primary Motor
 * Primary Sensory (Generic)
 * Modulatory (preSMA)

#### Basal Ganglia
 * Striatum (dMSN & iMSN)
 * GPe (short indirect)
 * STN (long indirect & hyperdirect)
 * GPi (Output Nucleus)

#### Subcortical
 * SNc
 * Thalamus
